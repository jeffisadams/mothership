Basic bash scripts to setup home automation and data collection.

## Motivation
This started because I was given a few Raspberry Pi Zeros and some temperature and Humidity gauges.  I thought it would be easy to write a bit of code and track temperature over time.  That part was pretty easy, and @sufinawaz had done most of the sensor work for me already.  All that was left was to install a database to track it.  How hard could it be to install elasticsearch?  Apparently harder than I thought.  So here are some scripts so I don't forget how.
